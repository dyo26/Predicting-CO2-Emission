This is my first time using Simple Linear Regression

When I learn about AI, This is my first ML Model
Given dataset about CO2 Emission, I tried to use most basic ML, Simple Linear Regression.
I predict the CO2 Emission based on Engine Size, because it has positive correlation.
I got 0.7157305716960854 as R2 Score
